    <p>
        After qualifying for state in the 2014, the Brookfield Central Boys golf team took a huge hit, losing 60 percent of their
        starting lineup. The only returning members were Sean Yun (‘16) and Josh Trasser (‘16). The three vacant spots in
        the lineup were filled up by Kevin Hershberger (‘16), Brandon Talaska (‘17), and Zach Mindel (‘18). Even with the
        huge change, the boys began the season with the same goals as the previous year: win conference, qualify for state,
        and be successful.
    </p>
    <p>The future of the team might have looked bleak to most,
            but Yun never doubted them. “We had many guys from last
            year’s reserve team that were ready to play,” He said. Talaska
            agreed, “I was so motivated to work my heart out and
            improve, as did everyone else.”</p>
    <p>With this attitude, the team approached every
            opportunity as positively as it could. Even though the boys
            did not meet the first two goals on the list, they were still
            able to achieve the third. They might not have placed first
            in the GMC, but all of the athletes achieved new personal
            bests in their high school careers. Talaska had a 39 at the
            3rd Conference mini-meet, Mindel an 83 at sectionals,
            Hershberger a 79 at regionals, and Yun a 74 at the Waukesha
            County Championship. They might not have qualified for
            
            state, but they sent Trasser, who, after shooting his career-
            best 76 at sectionals, moved on as an individual. He finished
            
            the season ranked 21st in the Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>Looking back, Yun and Talaska were not disappointed.
            Yun explained, “Although struggled, we are proud of our
            season. We worked hard and will continue to work hard and
            even better next year.”</p>
